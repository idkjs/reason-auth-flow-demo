# Reason React Navigation Auth Flow with Expo

## Motivation

Replicate the `react-navigation` AuthFlow Demo in ReasonML. The demo is here:
<https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/auth-flow.html>. I needed to understand how
to get some basic `switch` and `stack` navigation working together in
`ReasonML`. The binding for navigation are `WIP` at the excellent
[reason-react-native](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-native)
repo.
